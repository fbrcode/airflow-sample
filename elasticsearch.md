# Elasticsearch

<https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/>

Elasticsearch is the search engine for your data.
It is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases.
As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

Usually you will use:

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) which is the search engine.
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) which is a web interface for Elasticsearch.
- [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/) which is a data processing pipeline (allow to fetch data from different sources).
